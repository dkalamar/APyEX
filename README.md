# Apex Assistant
Tools to aid in the visualization and analysis of Apex Legends gameplay (In Progress)

The battle royale, Apex Legends, while it has a growing playerbase, has offered little support
for its professional community.This project aims to provide better coverage and visualizations
during scrimmages and tournaments, and analyze the results clearly and in real-time.

# Part 1) Killfeed tracking
There have been hundreds of scrims and tournaments by professional players that haven't been analyzed. This tool will use
OCR to create a log cache of a games killfeed so analysts don't have to watch every single game from every
players perspective.

# Part 2) Map Visualization
One of the worst parts of watching professional gameplay is that the only camera views come from
single first-person views one player at a time. This limits the audience from understanding the big
picture positioning and movements of all 20 teams, as well as sometimes missing the action, when the
coverage follows the wrong players. This tool will plot the paths of all players 

THIS PROJECT IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF VIEWERS AND ANALYSTS ONLY. WE DO NOT CONDONE THE USAGE OF ANY IN-GAME TOOLS TO GAIN A COMPETITIVE EDGE.
